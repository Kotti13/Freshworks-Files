My first days were fully occupied with orientation and the banking process. The next day, we were divided into sections with coaches, and a welcome kit was provided. The day included teaching and daily orientation, starting with problem-solving and brain exercise games. The following day was split into squads, and the tech coach, Bharathwaj Sir, explained some technical terms. ELS Ma'am Sukirthi was teaching some life skills, including how to speak English, story building, and group PPT presentations. In the ELS class, we watched a movie and practiced summarizing "Home Alone" to prepare for speaking.
